# ðŸ“Š Credit Card Fraud Detection - Exploratory Data Analysis

# Project Overview

This project aims to analyze client application data to identify factors contributing to payment difficulties.By uncovering these patterns, the analysis supports better risk assessment for future credit decisions.

# Dataset

The datasets used in this project is publicly available on [Dataset] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TSn_S3C7CzMVZ67F9wiW5EUz-lwMkmO0)

# EDA Objectives

1.Understanding the distribution of the data.

2.Identifying the class imbalance between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

3.Analyzing correlations between features.

4.Visualizing fraud trends using various statistical plots.

5.Highlighting key insights that can guide model building.

# Steps Involved

# 1. Data Loading

* Loaded all datasets and examined their structure (rows, columns, and data types).

# 2. Missing Value Treatment

* Identified columns with significant missing values.

* Dropped columns with excessive nulls.

* Filled numerical missing values with median and categorical values with mode.

# 3. Outlier Detection

* Checked for outliers that could skew results using statistical and visual methods.

# 4. Data Imbalance Check

* Analyzed distribution of the target variable to assess any imbalance in classes.

# 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Performed univariate, bivariate, and segmented univariate analysis.

* Used visualizations like histograms, boxplots, and bar charts to uncover data patterns.
